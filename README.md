# Web Projects

This repository hosts a collection of web projects and example sites, built using modern web development tools and AI-assisted workflows (e.g. ChatGPT and Lovable).

The goal of this repository is to:

- Provide reference implementations for small, production-ready websites
- Offer reusable layouts, components, and patterns
- Serve as a starting point for others who want to adapt or extend these projects
